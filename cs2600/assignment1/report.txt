1.) grep bluetooth sys_logs > bt_logs
2.) grep -e WARNING -e ERROR bt_logs > bt_error_logs
3.) grep -A 10 "power level: 4.5" sys_logs > power_logs
    cat ~/cs2600/assignment1/power_logs
4.) Well I know the wifi wouldn't affect the device since the radio waves are weaker than that
    of wifi. Practically speaking, I'd say that the two devices they're trying to pair are far away.    But if it's not any of those, it'll have to be some hardware/software issue. I'd likely report this
    to my team lead or manager, and then see where we can go from there. Maybe access some more information
    on the issue.
